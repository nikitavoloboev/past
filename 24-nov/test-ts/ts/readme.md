# TS

> TS libraries and other code

## Setup

Using [Bun](https://bun.sh).

Currently requires [ts-utils](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts-utils) to be present in `lib` folder (will be improved, PRs welcome).

```
mkdir lib && cd lib && git clone https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts-utils && cd ..
bun i
```

## Run

I use this repo to test TS code fast.

```
bun dev
```

Runs: `tput reset && bun --watch run.ts`

## Libraries

I publish [TS Utils lib](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts-utils).

## Scripts

Mostly use ts and this repo for scripts. [scripts/get-git-project-of-path.ts](scripts/get-git-project-of-path.ts) is good example. I then run them with [KM](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).
