## Install

> [!WARNING]
> WIP, not intended for public use yet, if you can help with making this package work with both JSR and NPM, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TVafwaD23d)

[JSR](https://jsr.io/@nikiv/utils) has instructions for each runtime.

## API

See [JSR](https://jsr.io/@nikiv/utils) overview (it also has search).

## Setup

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is used to run/install things.

```
bun i
```

## Run

```
bun dev
```

## Run Deno

This package also uses [Deno](https://deno.com) in [deno](deno) folder. Get [Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) for it.

```
deno task dev
```

Will run/watch [deno/main.ts](deno/main.ts).

## Publish

> [!WARNING]
> Needs to be fixed. Should be publishing to both JSR and NPM. Should publish all export code from here. Consumers of the package should somehow know if the function needs be ran in Bun/Deno/.. etc.

```
deno task publish
```
