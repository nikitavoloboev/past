## Try

- https://github.com/lotusdblabs/lotusdb
- https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-go
- setup [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com) and have fast setup to write, share and deploy code
  - both as libraries, CLIs, http services
- do some CLIs with [bubble tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- move `learn.rs` into a folder in `src/learn` and have many files
  - `slices.rs`, `structs.rs` etc. rather than have it all in one `learn.rs` file
