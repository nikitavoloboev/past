> Python libraries and other code

## Setup

Python setup is wip for me but for now to run the code inside, I installed [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

Then I run (I use fish shell):

```
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/fish/conf.d/conda.fish
conda activate mlx_code
```

Assumes [mlx_code conda env exists already](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment).

## Contribute

Always open to useful ideas or fixes in form of issues or PRs.

Can [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) (search [existing issues](../../issues) first) or [start discussion](../../discussions).

It's okay to submit draft PR as you can get help along the way to make it merge ready.
