## Contribute

Whilst this is a personal site, I am always open to useful suggestions/ideas.

Can see [existing issues](../../issues) for things being worked on. See [main issue](../../issues/25) for what's in focus right now.

Can [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) (search existing ones for duplicates first) or start discussion on [GitHub](../../discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TVafwaD23d).

Can always submit draft PRs with good ideas/fixes. You will be helped along the way to make it merge ready.
