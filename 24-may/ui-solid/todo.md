- deploy to `ui.nikiv.dev`
- integrate all components from https://codepen.io/jh3y and make into useful components
- use https://www.usegalileo.ai/explore
  - get a way to iterate fast on designs and make it useable in real projects fast
- check https://github.com/raidendotai/openv0
  - try make for solid / tailwind
  - should work as close to https://v0.dev in quality as possible
- deploy on ui.nikiv.dev
- do another repo for RN components
- add https://github.com/histoire-dev/histoire
- have CLI you can run with `bunx ..` that when ran will download the component and put it automatically into a user's project
  - so in UI, there is a way to just copy the code and paste it into your project
  - or copy this command, then when ran inside a project, it will try find a `components/` folder and create a file with that component code there
  - if there are multiple `/components/` folders, show it to user and let them decide which one to use
