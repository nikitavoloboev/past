👋 I love [making](../projects) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/) things.

🖋 I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/everything-I-know) in form of a [personal wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).

📚 My main focus is on building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), an [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz) website for learning any topic as fast as possible.

🥑 Together with building [KusKus](https://kuskus.app), a food/drink sharing app.

💻 I share fully my [macOS/iOS personal setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config). Where I share which apps/CLIs/configs I use and love. I [describe my workflow more extensively](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/my-workflow) in wiki and [course](https://macos.nikiv.dev). [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/) is life changing.

🌐 I share my thoughts on [X](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev). I share my [code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src) on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) and you can see photos I took on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev).

🎥 I also make educational [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw) and share [music playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev).

💻 I am passionate about [macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config) so I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

🐾 If you want to know even more about me, you can see [what I like](likes), read [my journal](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/looking-back) or [explore the wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).
