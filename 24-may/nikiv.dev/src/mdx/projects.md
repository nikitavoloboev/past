I am currently making [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) & [KusKus](https://kuskus.app). [Sharing things](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/), writing a [wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) and building [ideas](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ideas/).

All my code projects can be neatly seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src). In more detail they are:

## Learn Anything

[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) is an [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website to learn any topic as fast as possible.

The [end goal](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ideas/learn-anything) is to create a machine learning system that can craft personalized study plans for learning any topic and an open knowledge graph anyone can explore and extend.

## KusKus

[KusKus](http://kuskus.app) is an [open source](https://github.com/kuskusapp/kuskus) app for food/drink sharing.

## Alfred Workflows

I programmed some [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) workflows I still use. Keep a list of [some nice ones](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows) too.

- [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) - Search through any website (easily extendable list).
- [Ask Create Share](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share) - Create web submissions (Stack exchange, Reddit and more).
- [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-awesome-lists) - Browse all [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) in seconds.
- [Small workflows](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows) - Small Alfred workflows I use.

I plan to write a lot more Alfred and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) extensions.

## Preferred tech stack

Web apps/sites are all built with [Solid](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid)/[TypeScript](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/typescript/). Database uses [EdgeDB](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/databases/edgedb) served via [Grafbase](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/networking/graphql/grafbase) [GraphQL](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/networking/graphql). [Local first](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/databases/sqlite) architectures. Using [Tauri](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/rust/rust-libraries/tauri)/[Rust](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/rust) for desktop apps. [Expo](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/react/expo)/[SwiftUI](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/swift/swift-libraries/swiftui) for mobile apps. With some [Go](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/programming-languages/go/) servers. And [PyTorch](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/machine-learning/libraries/pytorch)/[MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) for neural nets.

## My macOS and iOS workflow

I share fully my [macOS/iOS personal setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config). Where I share which apps/CLIs/configs I use and love. I [describe my workflow more extensively](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/my-workflow) in wiki and [course](https://macos.nikiv.dev).

And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things automation on macOS/iOS.

## Curated lists

This part will be fully handled by [LA](https://learn-anything.xyz) soon. But I keep some [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists) which include things like [books](https://github.com/learn-anything/books), [courses](https://github.com/learn-anything/courses), [blogs](https://github.com/learn-anything/blogs) and more.

And I made a curated list of [privacy respecting tools and services](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting) and a list of ways to prepare and places to look to [find work programming](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/find-work) .

## Other things

I am continuously [learning](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/education/learning), [writing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/articles), reading [books](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/books/) and [research papers](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/research-papers/), [making videos](https://www.youtube.com/@nikitavoloboev/videos) and [writing code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev#src).
