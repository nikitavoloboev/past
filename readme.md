# Past

> Archive of code/things (sorted by month)

Folders are organized by `year-month`.

Repos that have useful git histories are archived in [GitHub org](https://github.com/past-nikiv) (rest is stripped of git histories and is moved here).

There is separate [past-try](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/past-try) repo for archiving states of [try](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/try) repo I use mostly to do isolated bug fixes or code exploration.
